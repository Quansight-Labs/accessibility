# Testing - Jupyter Accessibility

## WIP - Work in Progress

This directory is a place for accessibility testing within
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org).

As of May 10, 2022, it is a very early work in progress.

## Plans for the future

Automated accessibility tests cannot address accessibility issues on their own,
but used correctly they can be a useful tool.

This directory is modeled after the [JupyterLab
Benchmarks](https://github.com/jupyterlab/benchmarks/) repo.

The plan is to start with the JupyterLab web UI, then add testing for JupyterLab
docs, RetroLab UI, etc.
