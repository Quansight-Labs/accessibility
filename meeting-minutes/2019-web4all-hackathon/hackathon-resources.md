Per request in [jupyter/accessibility #2](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/issues/2), 
these notes help keep track of the work done on JupyterLab during 
the [2019 Web4All hackathon](http://www.w4a.info/2019/hackathon/). 
These notes are not comprehensive, but they do focus on content 
created during the hackathon that is not yet tracked elsewhere on
