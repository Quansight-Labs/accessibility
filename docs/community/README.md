# Joining our community

```{attention}
Jupyter Accessibility was recently converted into an official Jupyter Software Subporject.
We are currently working on our governance and decision making, please bear with us while we get this sorted.

## Team meetings and notes

The Jupyter Accessibility meets every two weeks to discuss what we have been up to, discuss important issues, make decisions, share ideas, and enjoy one another’s company. These meetings are open to anyone, whether you are interested in discussing a topic or listen in.
