# Get started contributing

Jupyter Accessibility is an open community made up of people all over the world.
We invite participation of all forms - whether that be contributing
design, code, advice, documentation, support, or joining our conversations!

If you'd like to start getting involved with Jupyter Accessibility projects,
here are a few resources to get you started.

## Do I really have something to contribute to Jupyter Accessibility?

Absolutely ‚úÖ. There are always ways to contribute to this community!

Access-centered practices require many skills, which means there are many ways in which you can help out.
Some examples include: providing feedback in issues, participating in the [Jupyter Accessibility Discourse](https://discourse.jupyter.org),
sharing your experience with Jupyter tools and their accessibility and usability features in an issue, improving documentation,
helping others with their problems, telling others about Jupyter Accessibility tools, and
coming to our community meetings.

If you are new accessibility practices, then **contributing to Jupyter Accessibility is a great way to learn**.
The Jupyter Accessibility community works hard to share its knowledge of both Jupyter tools and the
general problems that they try to solve, and we'd be happy to help you out.

If you're not sure where to start, look for the [![Shield badge -Good First Issue in our accessibility repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/-good%20first%20issue-blueviolet.svg)][link_goodfirstissue]
tag to begin your journey learning about accessibility within the Jupyter ecosystem.

## Get connected

First off, get yourself connected with the Jupyter Accessibility community online. There
are a few places where we have conversations and discussion.

- [Accessibility section of the Community forum][discourse-accessibility] - ongoing conversations and brainstorms around accessibility in the Jupyter ecosystem.
- [Jupyter Notebook Accessibility Issues][notebook-accessibility-issues] - all the `tag:Accessibility` issues in the Jupyter Notebook repository.
- [JupyterHub Accessibility Issues][jupyterhub-accessibility-issues] - all the `label:Accessibility` issues in the JupyterHub repository.
- [JupyterLab Accessibility Issues][jupyerlab-accessibility-issues] - all the `tag:Accessibility` issues in the JupyterLab repository.
- Review and join in contributing to [accessibility issues identified for the ongoing CZI EOSS grant](../funding/czi-grant-roadmap.md)

```{note}
As a reminder, we expect all members of the Jupyter Accessibility community to adhere to the
[Jupyter Code of Conduct][jupyter-coc] in these conversations.
```

## Contributing through GitHub

[git][link_git] is a really useful tool for version control.
[GitHub][link_github] sits on top of git and supports collaborative and distributed working.

You'll use [Markdown][markdown] to chat in issues and pull requests on GitHub.
You can think of Markdown as a few little symbols around your text that will allow GitHub
to render the text with formatting.
For example, you could write words as bold (`**bold**`), or in italics (`*italics*`),
or as a [link][rick_roll] (`[link](https://github.com/jupyter/acce)`) to another webpage or resource.

```{tip}
GitHub has a helpful page on
[getting started with writing and formatting Markdown on GitHub][writing_formatting_github].
```

## Find issues to work on

If you'd like to make contributions to one of the Jupyter repositories (this can
be either contributing code, commenting on issues, reviewing pull requests, or improving
documentation), we recommend checking out the **issue tags** to find issues that
are a good place to start.

Practices across projects vary - but in general folks try to use tags to signal different _types_ of issues. Two that you
might be interested in are **help wanted**, and **good first issue**.

The [GitHub Issues Search](https://github.com/issues)
can be used to quickly search across all the issues in a GitHub organization that match
one of these tags. Here are a few links below to help you get started:

- [![Badge - issue tag Help Wanted](https://img.shields.io/badge/-help%20wanted-159818.svg)][link_helpwanted]: _These issues contain a task that a member of the team has determined we need additional help with._

- [![Badge - issue tag Good First Issue](https://img.shields.io/badge/-good%20first%20issue-blueviolet.svg)][link_goodfirstissue]: _These issues contain a task that a member of the team thinks could be a good entry point to the project._

## Help by contributing to a specific repository

Note that Jupyter Accessibility works on many kinds of technology. The kind of tech you'll
use (as well as the set-up and skill needed to work on that tech) will depend on the
repository that you're working with.

For example, the [Zero to Jupyter Accessibility for Kubernetes](https://github.com/Jupyter Accessibility/zero-to-Jupyter Accessibility-k8s)
repository will touch on aspects of dev-ops and cloud infrastructure.

To get oriented with a specific repository's needs and process around making new
contributions, look for a **repository-specific contributing guide**. This often
comes in the form of a **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** file, or a section of the documentation.

For example, [here is the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for Zero to Jupyter Accessibility](https://github.com/Jupyter Accessibility/zero-to-Jupyter Accessibility-k8s/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
Note that it covers some of the tools you'll need for testing and developing the code,
which are not necessarily needed for the _other_ Jupyter Accessibility repositories.

**Are the contributing docs unclear or misleading?** Then please let us know! We try to
make this documentation as helpful as possible, but we often don't have the perspective of
a new member to the community. Your input is extremely valuable in making it easy for others
to join the Jupyter Accessibility community!

## Thank you!

You're awesome. üëãüèªüòäü¶Ñ
